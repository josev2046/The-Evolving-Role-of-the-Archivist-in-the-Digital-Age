1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.915
The 21st Century has fundamentally reshaped archival practice.

2
00:00:05.035 --> 00:00:07.315
Archivists are no longer solely custodians

3
00:00:07.655 --> 00:00:09.115
of tangible artifacts,

4
00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:12.315
but must navigate a complex information

5
00:00:12.865 --> 00:00:16.075
ecosystem characterized by contested truth

6
00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:18.195
and digital ephemerality.

7
00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:21.675
This necessitates a reevaluation

8
00:00:22.015 --> 00:00:26.235
of the traditional archival role, demanding an evolution

9
00:00:26.335 --> 00:00:27.755
beyond mere preservation

10
00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:30.635
and access to encompass critical analysis,

11
00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:32.155
ethical engagement,

12
00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:35.795
and the nuanced contextualization of both analog

13
00:00:35.815 --> 00:00:36.835
and digital records.

14
00:00:38.095 --> 00:00:41.155
The proliferation of digital technologies presents a

15
00:00:41.155 --> 00:00:44.555
paradox, an abundance of information coupled

16
00:00:44.555 --> 00:00:45.795
with inherent fragility.

17
00:00:47.055 --> 00:00:49.595
Unlike the physical degradation of analog media,

18
00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:51.915
digital records are susceptible

19
00:00:51.915 --> 00:00:56.155
to instantaneous disappearance, undetectable alteration,

20
00:00:56.735 --> 00:00:58.195
or deliberate manipulation.

21
00:00:59.105 --> 00:01:02.795
This poses a significant challenge for archivists committed

22
00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:04.395
to preserving a comprehensive

23
00:01:04.655 --> 00:01:06.195
and accurate historical record.

24
00:01:07.225 --> 00:01:10.835
Ephemeral digital content such as social media posts,

25
00:01:11.345 --> 00:01:13.275
messaging, app communications,

26
00:01:13.935 --> 00:01:17.995
and dynamic web content requires innovative capture

27
00:01:18.175 --> 00:01:19.795
and preservation strategies.

28
00:01:21.035 --> 00:01:23.155
Archivists must develop methodologies

29
00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:27.275
to archive these transient forms while maintaining their

30
00:01:27.275 --> 00:01:28.715
integrity and context.

31
00:01:29.825 --> 00:01:33.075
Furthermore, verifying the authenticity of digital records

32
00:01:33.855 --> 00:01:36.555
is paramount with emerging tools such

33
00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:40.075
as blockchain technology, digital signatures,

34
00:01:40.495 --> 00:01:42.155
and metadata analysis.

35
00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:44.795
Offering means to establish provenance

36
00:01:45.175 --> 00:01:46.715
and combat manipulation.

37
00:01:47.715 --> 00:01:50.515
A particular challenge arises from the digital footprint

38
00:01:50.775 --> 00:01:53.235
of techno fascist groups and governments.

39
00:01:54.105 --> 00:01:57.835
Such records are frequently designed for rapid dissemination

40
00:01:58.295 --> 00:01:59.715
and subsequent deletion,

41
00:02:00.255 --> 00:02:03.795
or meticulously curated to present a distorted reality.

42
00:02:04.715 --> 00:02:07.405
This difficulty is compounded by concerns

43
00:02:07.405 --> 00:02:10.725
regarding the politicization of record keeping

44
00:02:11.545 --> 00:02:15.245
as illustrated by recent events such as the dismissal

45
00:02:15.245 --> 00:02:19.165
of Colleen j Shogun, the archivist of the United States,

46
00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:23.285
following past disputes concerning classified documents.

47
00:02:24.235 --> 00:02:27.765
Such instances underscore the imperative for archivists

48
00:02:28.145 --> 00:02:31.965
to develop critical methodologies for contextualizing

49
00:02:32.425 --> 00:02:36.405
and analyzing these records, thereby distinguishing

50
00:02:36.405 --> 00:02:40.325
between manipulated narratives and authentic expressions.

51
00:02:41.305 --> 00:02:43.045
In an era of fake news

52
00:02:43.545 --> 00:02:44.965
and manipulated narratives,

53
00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:47.845
archivists must adopt a critically informed

54
00:02:48.325 --> 00:02:49.525
approach to information.

55
00:02:50.515 --> 00:02:54.325
This involves providing comprehensive contextual information

56
00:02:54.705 --> 00:02:58.885
for all records, including metadata, provenance, and

57
00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:01.525
Historical background to enable uses

58
00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:04.325
to critically evaluate the information encountered.

59
00:03:04.895 --> 00:03:07.845
Developing frameworks for assessing the reliability

60
00:03:08.305 --> 00:03:10.365
and bias of information sources,

61
00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:14.645
particularly within the digital realm, is also essential

62
00:03:15.275 --> 00:03:18.285
requiring an understanding of the algorithms

63
00:03:18.385 --> 00:03:21.365
and platforms that shape information dissemination.

64
00:03:22.245 --> 00:03:26.805
Moreover, archivists must navigate the ethical complexities

65
00:03:26.985 --> 00:03:30.845
of preserving and providing access to potentially harmful

66
00:03:31.345 --> 00:03:32.925
or controversial materials,

67
00:03:33.795 --> 00:03:38.165
necessitating careful consideration of privacy, security,

68
00:03:38.825 --> 00:03:40.045
and potential misuse.

69
00:03:41.275 --> 00:03:43.675
Archivists play a vital role in connecting

70
00:03:43.675 --> 00:03:45.155
communities with their history.

71
00:03:45.985 --> 00:03:49.995
This involves engaging with social collectives, individuals,

72
00:03:49.995 --> 00:03:52.635
and community organizations to document

73
00:03:52.855 --> 00:03:54.395
and preserve their histories.

74
00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:55.995
Fostering trust

75
00:03:56.375 --> 00:04:00.635
and collaborative partnerships equally important is the

76
00:04:00.635 --> 00:04:02.555
promotion of digital literacy

77
00:04:02.975 --> 00:04:07.075
and critical thinking skills among users, empowering them

78
00:04:07.375 --> 00:04:08.795
to navigate the complexities

79
00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:11.275
of the digital information landscape.

80
00:04:12.375 --> 00:04:15.895
Ensuring broad accessibility to archival materials

81
00:04:15.915 --> 00:04:18.055
for researchers, educators,

82
00:04:18.635 --> 00:04:21.495
and the general public necessitates the development

83
00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:24.055
of user-friendly interfaces

84
00:04:24.515 --> 00:04:27.135
and adherence to open access principles.

85
00:04:28.355 --> 00:04:32.055
The 21st century thus demands a fundamental

86
00:04:32.895 --> 00:04:35.135
re-imagining of the archivist's role.

87
00:04:35.965 --> 00:04:38.735
This requires moving beyond traditional notions

88
00:04:38.735 --> 00:04:41.215
of preservation to embrace a more dynamic

89
00:04:41.715 --> 00:04:42.855
and engaged approach.

90
00:04:43.445 --> 00:04:46.415
Entailing the navigation of digital ephemerality,

91
00:04:47.195 --> 00:04:50.335
the adoption of a critical stance towards information

92
00:04:51.075 --> 00:04:52.135
and the cultivation

93
00:04:52.235 --> 00:04:54.695
of collaborative partnerships with communities.

94
00:04:55.635 --> 00:04:57.135
By addressing these challenges,

95
00:04:57.815 --> 00:05:00.975
archivists can play a crucial role in safeguarding

96
00:05:00.975 --> 00:05:05.375
collective memory, ensuring future generations have access

97
00:05:05.435 --> 00:05:09.255
to a comprehensive and accurate understanding of the past.

98
00:05:10.195 --> 00:05:12.615
The archivist is no longer a passive guardian,

99
00:05:13.075 --> 00:05:15.495
but an active participant in the construction

100
00:05:15.755 --> 00:05:16.855
of historical truth.
